# *(Easy)*: Make a tiny video game!

**Please note this is an official week-long challenge; all submissions are due by Monday night, midnight, GMT - 7:00 (American pacific time). Winners announced the following Tuesday evening.**

The TI-83+ graphing calculator series is the "ultimate" gaming platform: it has a 96 by 64 glorious pixel screen, four brilliant colors (white, light-grey, dark-grey, and black) per pixel, full keyboard input, and it all fits in the palm of your hand! Best of all, it is a *programmable* calculator, allowing you to make awesome games while sitting in class not listening to your teacher or professor...

All jokes aside, this calculator-platform is great for the fact that it's a very simple platform to program and has had a [ton of games](http://www.ticalc.org/pub/83plus/basic/games/) developed for it already. Many young programmers today attribute their passion for programming to how fun the TI-83+ was to develop on!

**Your goal is to write a game on whatever hardware and software platform you like, but you must stick with the "look & feel" of the TI-83+**: you can make any game you want using any tools you have, but you may _only_ output to a 96 x 64 pixel screen and _only_ use four grayscale colors. This screen may scale for easier viewing, but the pixel-count should never change. If you do not want to make an interactive game, you are welcomed to make a [demo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demo_(computer_programming\)).

**We will award the most unique game, most impressive game, and best demo with +1 gold ribbons to your flair. Winners get Reddit Gold.**

Since this challenge is very open-ended and may not be clear, I've written a [demo for users to play](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/nint22/JSPhoenix/blob/master/index.htm) and [develop off of](https://github.com/nint22/JSPhoenix). You are welcomed to use this code as a starting point, or just simply start fresh.

If you actually end up writing something functional on an actual calculator, try to post a video or pictures! We will roll out silver medals for you if it's a functioning game or demo.
